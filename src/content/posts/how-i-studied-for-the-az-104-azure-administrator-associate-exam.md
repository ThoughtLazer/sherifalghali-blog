When I took the Azure AZ-104 exam in August, I was able to pass confidently because I used the following resources. I hope that if you're studying for the exam, you find the same resources helpful.

### Exam Ref AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator

I actually bought and read the physical copy of the [exam reference guide](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/exam-ref-az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator-9780136805380) from Microsoft. I took it with me everywhere for about a month. Anytime I had to wait for anything, I started reading the book. This helped me build a framework for understanding the various concept the exam covers.

### Playing Around in the Azure Environment

I cannot overstate how important it is to actually play around in Azure. Create a VM. Create a resource group. Peer a network. All of these things were very important for me to understand how the different services interact.

### John Savill's Technical Training on YouTube

John Savill's [AZ-104 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOod_VNgdJk&list=PLlVtbbG169nGlGPWs9xaLKT1KfwqREHbs) and [study cram video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOod_VNgdJk) were very instrumental in helping me pull all the concepts together. It is amazing that all his content is available on YouTube for free.

### Using Tutorials Dojo Practice Exams

The [Tutorials Dojo](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator-practice-exams/) practice exams helped me bring all the concepts together. The questions were similar in concept to what was in the exam, but crucially, they were not brain dumps. The reason I like practice exams is that I learn to think a little more critically about scenarios that I may experience in real life.

### Conclusion

These tools helped me study for and pass the exam. I hope that they help you along in your Azure certification journey.
